# p2p-RPS
Rock paper and scissors p2p 
Python 3

It's quite simple, just follow these few steps:
1. Open the server and network files, then, change in both the var server to contain your ip address in str format.
(works just fine w/ hamachi)
2. Run the server file, it will print "Server Started" if you did the step before.
3. Run the client to play it.
Needs 2 clients to play it (1 for each player, ofc)
